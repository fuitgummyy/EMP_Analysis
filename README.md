performs a fourier transform on a signal/array, simulates its interaction through the ionosphere. 

How to run:
I use Gnuplot to display the dataset
Once you have run the code to generate the fourier transform data table, paste the code from 'gnuplot_outofiono.txt' into Gnuplot

something to note: I have made the FT program to read the datafile where I have stored it locally on my laptop,  making it not universally readable. 


**Currently working on: fixing the simulated ionosphere and high pass filter, adding simulation for earth's magnetic field.**
