performs a fourier transform on a signal/array, simulates its interaction through the ionosphere. 

How to run:
I use Gnuplot to display the dataset
Once you have run the code to generate the fourier transform data table, paste the code from 'gnuplot_outofiono.txt' into Gnuplot


**Update: fixed ionosphere simulation, added a double exponential as signal to be fed in, created simple highpass filter, started simulating earth's magnetic field.**
**Currently working on: finalizing simulations for left circular, right circular and combined movement due to earth's magnetic field, displaying results of multiple simulations, spectrogram**
